A very early version of a SCEP server and library written in go. Take this as notes on reading the [SCEP IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gutmann-scep-02)
The repo includes a sample CA and configuration profile you can use to try SCEP enrollment.

A OS X binary [release](https://github.com/micromdm/scep/releases/tag/v0-dev) is available for testing.

# plans
`github.com/micromdm/scep` will become both a Go library and a standalone SCEP server/SCEP proxy.
